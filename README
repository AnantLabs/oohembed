## oohEmbed What?

In a nutshell: __oohEmbed is an oEmbed compatible provider of HTML embed codes for various web sites.__

What is this oEmbed? From [oembed.com](http://www.oembed.com/):

> oEmbed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites. 
> The simple API allows a website to display embedded content (such as photos or videos) when 
> a user posts a link to that resource, without having to parse the resource directly.

Still don't get it? Perhaps an example will make things clear. If you make a URL request like this:

    http://oohembed.com/oohembed/?url=http%3A//www.amazon.com/Myths-Innovation-Scott-Berkun/dp/0596527055/

You will get this as the response:

{
     "asin": "0596527055", 
     "title": "The Myths of Innovation", 
     "url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31%2BfVjL2nqL.jpg", 
     "thumbnail_width": "48", 
     "height": "500", 
     "width": "317", 
     "version": "1.0", 
     "author_name": "Scott Berkun", 
     "provider_name": "Amazon Product Image", 
     "thumbnail_url": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31%2BfVjL2nqL._SL75_.jpg", 
     "type": "photo", 
     "thumbnail_height": "75", 
     "author_url": "http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0596527055%26location=/Myths-Innovation-Scott-Berkun/dp/0596527055"
}

That should make everything clear. No? Then head over to http://oohEmbed.com/ for more details!

## What's in the source?

If you are reading this file, you've chanced upon the source code that powers oohEmbed.com

Yes, the code running behind oohEmbed.com is open source (BSD License) and is available at
http://code.google.com/p/oohembed/

## Brief Overview

oohEmbed is running on Google App Engine and so what you see in the source files is a Python
app meant to run on App Engine. Thus, some familiarity with App Engine would be a good thing
to have before jumping into the code.

Although oohEmbed is a Google App Engine app, there is very little App Engine specific in the
code itself. Apart from the use of `urlfetch`, everything else is standard Python and should 
run anywhere that Python runs.

The codebase is so small that hopefully, it is self-explanatory! If you have any questions,
please feel free to ask!
